## Building on Linux

**Update Locales**:
Before building, update the locales by running the following commands in your terminal:
```bash
export LC_NUMERIC="C"
export LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8"
```

These commands set the numeric locale to `en_US.UTF-8`, enabling compatibility with formatting requirements during the build process.
